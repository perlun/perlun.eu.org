* 2022
  * [**Perlang**](https://github.com/perlang-org/perlang) (116h): Continued towards [the 0.2.0 release](https://github.com/perlang-org/perlang/releases/tag/v0.2.0), which was eventually released on 2022-06-11:

        > The second public release of Perlang. Most notable changes are the added support for `uint` and `ulong` data types, as well as increased test coverage for binary operators (`+`, `-`, `*` and so forth). As of this release, our test suite covers all supported (numeric) type combinations.

        The full list of commits during the year can be found [here](https://github.com/perlang-org/perlang/commits/master/?since=2022-01-01&until=2022-12-31).
  * **Poc.Hemekonomi** (8h): A simple tool for managing your personal finances. Written in .NET as a [Blazor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazor) app with a console/CLI app to import CSV files from my bank into a Postgres database. The project is unfortunately not publicly available at the moment; I am hoping to make something similar like this released as [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) sometime in the future (but not necessarily based on this exact code base).
  * **[perlun.eu.org](https://github.com/perlun/perlun.eu.org)** (8h): I wrote [a few blog posts](https://github.com/perlun/perlun.eu.org/commits/master/?since=2022-01-01&until=2022-12-31) during the year:
      - [The dangers of referential equality in Java](https://perlun.eu.org/en/2021/12/30/the-dangers-of-referential-equality-in-java)
      - [Därför är jag framgångsteolog](https://perlun.eu.org/sv/2022/08/12/darfor-ar-jag-framgangsteolog) (Swedish)
  * **[dotfiles](https://github.com/perlun/dotfiles)** (6h): A bunch of [small changes](https://github.com/perlun/dotfiles/commits/master/?since=2022-01-01&until=2022-12-31) here and there. I also got a new work laptop, which affected this a bit; I wanted to document even more details about my preferred setup.
  * [**jOOQ**](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ) (2h): jOOQ is a DSL for writing SQL in Java which we use in my work. I made a few minor PRs, of which this one is the most substantial: [Automatically enable table generation if indexes are enabled (#12993)](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/pull/12993)
  * [**rebase-editor**](https://github.com/sjurba/rebase-editor/) (1h, probably more in reality): I helped [fix a bug](https://github.com/sjurba/rebase-editor/pull/30) in this nice little interactive editor for `git rebase`. My changes weren't merged as-is, because they caused some issues with the tests but it still helped push the  bug fix forward. (I believe I might still be using my patched version in fact, because it works better for me. :grin:)
