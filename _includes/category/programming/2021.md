* 2021

  * [**Perlang**](https://github.com/perlang-org/perlang) (97h): Continued towards the first `0.1.0` release. It's nice to not in any way be bound by any "external" timetable of any form for this project. Perlang is simply a sparetime interest of mine where I am free to decide _when_ and _how_ to release (or not release) the software. I really enjoy this, to be honest. Even though I have spent a fair amount of time on the project already, and it definitely is usable (at least for REPL/simple scenarios like calculating `2 ** 32` and so forth), there are still [open bugs](https://github.com/perlang-org/perlang/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.1.0+label%3Abug) (3 at the time of writing) that I am aware of. I am currently planning to both fix these, and perhaps add some new functionality as well, before I call it a `0.1.0.` release.

        Here are some of the achievements during the year (full list of commits [here](https://github.com/perlang-org/perlang/compare/555b4a91a74a004368976c2cc9159ed41b8a56dd...3dda89d0ed72aeca69ede6cb14b3ecfb77fe083d)):
        * Various docs/website-related improvements: [6a0802a][6a0802a], [#154][154], [#156][156], [c9c7393][c9c7393], [#166][166], [#173][173], [#175][175], [#176][176], [#179][179], [#192][192], [#194][194]...
        * Upgrade to .NET 5.0 ([#126][126]) and .NET 6 ([#223][223])
        * Implement addition and subtraction assignment ([#148][148]) and modulo operator ([#152][152])
        * Add `long` ([#210][210]), `double` ([#236][236]) and `bigint` ([#238][238]) types, fix integer expansions to `bigint` ([#234][234]).
        * Support hexadecimal ([#217][217]), binary ([#219][219]) and octal literals ([#220][220]).
        * Move away from using the `dynamic` keyword ([#225][225], [#237][237])
        * A bunch of bug fixes and other improvements ([#188][188], [#199][199], [#235][235]...)
  * **perlun.eu.org** (16h): I wrote a few blog posts, where this one is one that I'd particularly like to highlight: [Saying goodbye to an old friend: Decommissioning a Raspberry Pi web server][decommissioning-blog-post]. Writing this blog post was only part of the job; doing the actual work to planning the move, figuring out where to host things and so forth was also a bit of an effort. See the actual post for more details.

        I also moved the CI which is used to publish the website to https://perlun.eu.org away from Travis, over to GitHub Actions: [#28](https://github.com/perlun/perlun.eu.org/pull/28). There is little reason to not use the built-in GitHub Actions these days, at least for my kind of use cases. One of the best things about GitHub Action is that the delay before a job starts is really low (more or less "instant" once you push your code). This is nice; I don't like waiting on computers. :slightly\_smiling\_face:
  * **halleluja.nu** (10h): Some new content was written and published:
      * [Tycker Gud om mig?](https://www.halleluja.nu/sv/undervisning-fran-bibeln/2021/2/26/tycker-gud-om-mig/), a short sermon in Swedish.
      * [A new Bible Study section](https://www.halleluja.nu/en/bible-study/) was added (in English). My aim is to write a sort of "commentary" on the Bible, chapter-by-chapter. Now, there are 929+260 chapters in the Christian bible, so going through them all will probably take a "few more years" at this pace... :sweat\_smile: Nonetheless, you need to start somewhere. :rocket:
  * **sitegen** (6h): Not much to mention here, except that [I gave F# a brief try](https://github.com/perlun/sitegen/pull/53). F# is a functional programming language in the [ML family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)) which seems a bit interesting. A friend of mine (Tobias Lindqvist) is very interested in it and has been speaking positively about it to me. I tried it out and it was indeed quite nice, with a fairly elegant syntax. It was also nice to be able to create methods with "non-standard names" like `creates a non-null TopLevelConfig.Config`: this is impossible in languages like C# but quite simple in F#.

        I ended up [rewriting the class in question in C#](https://github.com/perlun/sitegen/pull/54/files#r670768803) instead, because of the fact that F# lacked inner classes which I wanted to use for grouping my test methods. Nonetheless, it was interesting to try out a new programming language; it's not something you do every day.
  * [**darkerfx**](https://github.com/perlun/darkerfx) (5h): No web site is complete without a proper "dark theme"; [perlang.org](https://perlang.org) is no exception to this rule. The Perlang web site is built using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/), and there was already a dark theme for DocFX named [darkfx](https://github.com/steffen-wilke/darkfx). I made some changes to the theme and also converted the CSS to SASS. All in all, this was a fun endeavour and I do actually enjoy doing some frontend work from time to time. As long as I can stay away from the horrors of Javascript... :stuck\_out\_tongue:
  * [**ansible-config**](https://github.com/perlun/ansible-config) (5h): While doing the work described in the blog post [previously mentioned][decommissioning-blog-post], I also extracted some Ansible roles from my existing "roles+config" repo, along with some new roles, and published them in a GitHub repo. It's not very fancy at all, but especially for those of you not yet familiar with Ansible it could perhaps be a bit useful as inspiration for your own roles.
  * [**dotfiles**](https://github.com/perlun/dotfiles) (4h): As usual, a bit of work here and there on this repo was made during the year. I want to highlight one particular commit: [f03d340](https://github.com/perlun/dotfiles/commit/f03d34031f1494a730bf4444e1ecdeb662bff49f), in which I added `dark_mode` and `light_mode` shell aliases (well, in fact, _shell functions_). This was useful for me when doing "out-on-the-balcony" hacking in the summer time, where the sunlight simply made the usage of a dark theme impractical. Off to the terminal and type `light_mode`, and there you go - switching both the Firefox, Cinnamon and GTK themes all in one go. :sunglasses:

        Unfortunately, I had some struggles with VS Code getting it to properly detect the theme being changed. It turns out that this is caused by an [Electron/Chromium limitation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/91169). I guess this is one of the disadvantages of running GNU/Linux as your desktop OS; it's clearly less common than Windows and macOS. :neutral\_face:
  * **protobuf** (2h): This was an interesting experience. I [created a pull request](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/8131), based on an initial effort from another contributor that hadn't been merged. I don't regularly work with C++, so it was nice to be able to do something in that language for a change (I historically used C++ quite extensively, for example when writing the [tanstaafl](https://github.com/perlun/tanstaafl) Fidonet client in the late '90s, but I haven't used it professionally for many, many years).

        One thing that struck me was the compilation times: it took _ages_ just to be able to build the project (which isn't _that_ huge, I think). Compared to other languages I regularly use (Java and C#), the difference is significant. This is in one way expected since both of these languages compile to _intermediate_ form instead of building "full" native binaries (like C and C+++ does), but still: it was an interesting thing to realize.
  * [**sudo-1.8.3p1-patched**](https://github.com/perlun/sudo-1.8.3p1-patched) (1h): Finally, a few words about this one. Sometimes, life brings you to do rather odd things - this was clearly one of the more unexpected things this year. Because of [CVE-2021-3156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156) and an old Ubuntu 12.04 machine that needed to be patched, I spent some time essentially "backporting" the Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) fix to the `sudo` package in Ubuntu 12.04. In one way, this was a fun exercise since I don't tend to do that much C programming these days. In another way, it's obviously a bit sad to have to spend time patching a server running a 9-year old Linux distro which is well past the EOL time. But, what do you do...
