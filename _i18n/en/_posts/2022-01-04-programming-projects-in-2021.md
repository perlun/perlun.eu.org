It has again become time to summarize the top FOSS projects I've been involved with during the past year. Not all projects I worked on are listed; I've tried to limit it to the ones where I spent the largest amount of time, or where I consider the project/work done to be particularly interesting for one reason or another.

(The text below is an excerpt from my general page about programming which can be found [here](/en/programming).)

{% capture programming_2021 %}{% include category/programming/2021.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ programming_2021 | markdownify }}

There we go, you've reached the end. Thanks for going through the year together with me.

Wish you all the best for the new year! :thumbsup:
