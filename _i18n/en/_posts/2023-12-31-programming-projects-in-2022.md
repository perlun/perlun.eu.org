This is a post where I summarize some of the projects I have been hacking on during 2022. Note that only "non-work" related projects are covered by this list. FOSS projects which I have been able to contribute to during work time are included, though.

The year has been rather rough for me, which affected the energy I was able to put on these projects this time. It might also be part of the reason why it took me a full year (until New Year's Eve 2023) before I started writing this blog post.

(The text below is an excerpt from my general page about programming which can be found [here](/en/programming).)

{% capture programming_2022 %}{% include category/programming/2022.md %}{% endcapture %}

There we go, you've reached the end. Thanks for going through the year together with me.

Wish you all the best for the new year! :thumbsup:
